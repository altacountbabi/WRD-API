# Requirements:

1. A brain
2. Node.js and npm

# How to use:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open cloned repository with a terminal
3. Run this command in the terminal to install required dependencies: `npm i`
4. Run this command to start the dev server: `npm run dev`
5. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

# Known Issues:

1. This will only work on localhost:5173 for now, this is because I was too lazy to get api params to work on some of the api end points
2. UI is not responsive (not planning to fix this)
